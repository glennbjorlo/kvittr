# Kvittr

This is my Kvittr clone.

On this website you can read Kvittr-messages, or kveets, as a non-registered user. Members can post kveets and thumb up single messages. 

To register, follow the link 'Register'. And to log in, simply click 'Log in'. 

After logging in, the front page will turn into your profile page. To post a kveet, click 'The Wall' and you will find a text field for writing new kveets on the top of the page. You can give a thumbs up for a kveet by clicking 'MORE', and you will be taken to a new page where that kveet is displayed. 

If you want to update your profile information, just go to Settings and do the changes that you need.


Other information:

The functionality for uploading a profile picture is not currently working. Uploading a picture is only possible from admin. The best option to fix this, is to make a new model and view for user registration where the image field is present from the beginning. And then make a view for updating the image field when a user wants to upload a profile picture, much the same way as you can update profile information.
